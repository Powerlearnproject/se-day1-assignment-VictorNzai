Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. 
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to develop and maintain high-quality software systems.
It  is important as it enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life such as healthcare, finance and transportation.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.  
The term "software engineering" was first introduced at a NATO conference to address the software crisis caused by increasing complexity and lack of structured methodologies.

Winston Royce introduced the Waterfall model, which provided a structured sequential approach to software development.

The Agile methodology was introduced, promoting iterative development, customer collaboration, and adaptability over rigid planning.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements- This phase is to gather and document user needs and system requirements.
Design- Create system architecture and design components.
Implementation- Write code based on design specifications.
Testing- Validate functionality (unit, integration, system tests)
Deployment- Release the product to users.
Maintenance- Fix bugs, update features, and optimize performance post-launch.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall

Has Linear and sequential phases
This is more iterative and includes incremental spronts
Rigid requirements.

Agile
More Flexible to changes during the development cycle
Customer incolvement is limited until te final product
The customer is more involved since it accommodates feedback




Waterfall Example: Building a payroll system with fixed regulations.
Agile Example: Developing a mobile app requiring frequent user feedback

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer: Writes code, debugs, and collaborates on technical design with the team he has.
QA Engineer: Designs and executes test cases, identifies bugs, and ensures quality standards.
Project Manager: Manages and oversees timelines, budgets, and team coordination.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDE)- An example is Visual Studio Code. These provide tools for coding, debugging, and testing in a single environment.
Version Control systems - An example is Github, Git, SVN. Its importance is it enables developers to track changes and manage code versions and also promotes collaboration

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Challenge

Keeping up with the ever changing technology- Solution- Can be solved by engaging in continuous learning and participating in developer communities. 
Tight Deadlines Solution- Prioritization of tasks and use of agile sprint methods
Mental Health 





Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Validates and tests individual components (e.g.,verifying a login function or file upload).
Integration Testing: Checks interactions between modules (for example API connections).
System Testing: Assesses the entire systemâ€™s is in compliance with requirements.
Acceptance Testing: Ensures the software meets user expectations.

Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining text prompts to effectively interact with AI models.
Importance:
Enhances the accuracy and usefulness of AI-generated outputs.
Reduces ambiguity and misinterpretation.
Enables automation of complex tasks in AI-driven applications.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt:
"Tell me about AI."
Improved Prompt:
"Explain artificial intelligence in simple terms, including its main types (narrow AI vs. general AI) and give two real-world applications."


Why the improved prompt is better:
It is concise and clear. The promt removesambiguity making it clear what is expected and it also ensures the AI provides a structured and relevance response
